                    A code of markups and styles to show,<br>
                    HTML and CSS, like Hamlet and Othello,<br>
                    Together they bring a website to fellow.<br><br>
                    
                    HTML, the structure, the bones of the site,<br>
                    Elements and tags, a web of delight,<br>
                    H1, P, Div, and more,<br>
                    Together they form a page to adore.<br><br>
                    
                    But lo, the design must also shine,<br>
                    For that, dear friends, we have CSS divine,<br>
                    With selectors, properties, and values so true,<br>
                    A site can become a work of art anew.<br><br>
                    
                    Colors and fonts, spacing and more,<br>
                    CSS doth help us to explore,<br>
                    The beauty of the web, the design so fine,<br>
                    HTML and CSS together, a pair so divine.<br><br>
                    
                    So let us praise these languages so great,<br>
                    For they doth make the web truly ornate,<br>
                    HTML and CSS, a wondrous pair,<br>
                    For building sites with beauty so rare.<br><br>
